TODO by Sunday Dec 4th:

Break points:
	-Figure out how to put break points in the simulation.
	-Determine where we want out break points are.
	   - One "day" into the sim, then after learning
	-Have it output useful data at each break point.
	
	
Belief System:
	-Index states by time stamp
	-States are to have a value based on the number of waiting cars in each lane
		-These values would inform the decision to change the light phase and give priority to certain lanes based on time of day.
		

Display data:
	-Show a live count of average wait time for cars at the intersection
		-Possibly by lane.
	-Make the data generated at the break points look pretty.


Car Distribution:
	-Modify the number of cars going in a direction based on the time stamp include "rush hours"
	
	
(Optional) Modularity:
	-Make the number of cars that the sensors can pick up alterable with an argument passed to the simulation on launch
	-Make the simulation length dynamic based on an argument passed to the simulation on launch
	


(Optional) Other agents:
	-Do some other kinds of agents so we can compare their data with our agent.
		-Realistically this isn't happening and would require more than one intersection.
